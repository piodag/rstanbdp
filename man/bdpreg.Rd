\details{
The Bayesian Deming regression can be run in a traditional fashion. In this case the error term is
sampled from a \eqn{T} distribution with \eqn{N-2} degree of freedom (\eqn{N} sample size).

The Bayesian Deming regression can be run as a robust regression specifying a decreased \eqn{df} parameter.
It is possible to set \eqn{df = 1} and perform the sampling from an extremely robust Cauchy distribution
to suppress leveraged outliers. For moderate robustness a reasonably low value of \eqn{df} in the interval
\eqn{[6;10]} can be an appropriated choice.

\code{ErrorRatio} can be set as usual for classical Deming regression. Default is 1. Strong
\code{ErrorRatio} can lead to instability in the chains that may not converge after the burn in. For
this purpose the \code{trunc} parameter can be used. In this way the normal distribution for the
slope gets truncated at a minimum of 0.3333 (default). The parameter \code{slopeTruncMin}
can override this value.

With the parameter \code{heteroschedastic} it is possible to use an alternative regression which
models the heteroscedasticity with a linear growing variance. \code{Alpha} and \code{Beta} are the
intercept and the slope for the variance variation. \code{Alpha} must be > 0. \code{Beta} is usually
zero if no real heteroscedasticity is detected. Alternatively \code{Beta} shows low positive values,
typically below 0.5 if heteroscedasticity is successfully modeled. The CI of \code{Beta} could indeed
act as a test for heteroscedasticity. According to these empiric observations, \code{Beta} is also
truncated to avoid erratic behavior of the Hamiltonian sampler.

The Bayesian Deming regression is recommended in many cases where traditional and non parametric
method fail. It is particularly convenient with very small data set and/or with data set with low
digit precision. In fact Bayesian Deming regression has no problem with ties.

The method with linear heteroscedastic fitting can be a meaningful answer to heteroscedastic
data set. The CI are much narrower and the trade off between robustness and power can find
a natural solution. It must be considered as highly experimental but also highly promising
method. Users are advised to carefully check the sampled output for undesirable correlation
between Alpha and/or Beta vs the slope and/or intercept. A plot with \code{pairs()} highly
recommended.

Stan is usually good enough that init values for the chains must not be specified. In extreme cases
it is anyway possible to set init values as a list of list.
