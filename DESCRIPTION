Description: Bayesian Deming (robust) Regression. Regressions methods
    to quantify the relation between two measurement methods. This package
    focus is on a Bayesian Deming regressions family. With a Bayesian
    method the Deming regression can be run in a traditional fashion or
    can be run in a robust way just decreasing the d.f. of the sampling
    distribution. With d.f = 1 an extremely robust Cauchy distribution
    can be sampled. Moreover, models for dealing with heteroscedastic data
    are also provided.
