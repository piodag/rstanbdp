Description: Regression methods to quantify the relation 
    between two measurement methods are provided by this package. The
    focus is on a Bayesian Deming regressions family. With a Bayesian
    method the Deming regression can be run in a traditional fashion or
    can be run in a robust way just decreasing the degree of freedom
    d.f. of the sampling distribution. With d.f = 1 an extremely robust
    Cauchy distribution can be sampled. Moreover, models for dealing
    with heteroscedastic data are also provided. For reference see
